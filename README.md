# Learning to Program in .NET
Hi,

Hopefully you're here because you want to learn how to program, and hey I'm going to teach you.

## Objective Categories
Each category has a list of **Objectives**. These objectives are in order of understanding. It's like math, you gotta understand how to add before you can derive `f(x)`.

However, you can (and will) jump between **Categories** to learn pieces together. It will be a while before you can make a full fledged application with a database and UI, but hey baby steps.

### Tools
1. IDE / Editor
1. Language
1. Compiler / Interpreter
1. Debugger
1. Version Control

### Language
1. Variables
1. Expressions
1. Assignments
1. Conditionals
1. Loops
1. Functions
1. Classes
1. Inheritance

## Lessons
Each **Lesson** will look something like this:

> # Lesson
> Here will be a general overview, as well as introducing the final problem
> # Objectives
> ## Objective
> ### Concept
> Here you will learn about the objective, each component of the objective, and some applications.
> ### Example
> Here you will be shown an example of the objective, with relevant components pointed out or commented.
> ### Practice
> Here you will be presented with a problem
> 
> ...
> 
> This will be repeated for the number of objectives in the lesson
> # Project
